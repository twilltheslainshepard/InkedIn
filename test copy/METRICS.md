# Metrics 
- Metric 1 (Happiness) - Firestore database will be used to store user feedback such as ratings and reviews as well as tracking user actions like bookings and survey responses through google analytics. 
- Metric 2 (Engagement) - Google Analytics via Firebase, see how long people spend on explore page and track general data using it. 
- Metric 3 (Adoption) - We will use a variable to keep track of whether users click "Book" or not within the first 3 days of creating an account. We can possibly use Google analytics to see how many downloads we are getting over time.
- Metric 4 (Retention) - We will keep track of a user variable that logs how many times a user clicks "Book". We will also do the same for when a user logs in through Firebase authentication.
- Metric 5 (Task Success) - Implement event tracking within firebase to moniter successful bookings and error-free navigating through the booking process (golden process).
